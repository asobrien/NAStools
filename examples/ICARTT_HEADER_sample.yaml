                    Cookie number density as measured by Cookie Monster during
                    flight. This value is extrapolated to the entire cabin but
                    is a discreet measurement of cookies/seat during flight.
                    There is inherent uncertainty in the measurement as cookies
                    are eaten in flight while being counted.
# OPTIONAL long descriptive name (above), leave blank if not required.
#  Long descriptions may be entered over multiple lines:
#     `>` forces multi-lines comments onto a single line in output file
#     `|` forces line breaks (formatting) to be respected.
#  Align all subsequent lines with the formatting character to ensure no errors.

SPECIAL_COMMENTS:   >
                    A significant number of cookies were eaten during the flight 
                    so the uncertainty is larger than usual.
